RTx::Tags
    Tag Cloud support for RT with simple-searchable custom fields.

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses portions of HTML::TagCloud to provide a tag cloud on
    Search/Simple.html The cloud consists of the values (split on commas,
    semi-colons and whitespace) for all objects with the `Tags' custom
    field.

    In addition to the cloud, documentation for using the Simple Searchable
    Custom Fields patch is included on the page, since the patch is required
    in order for the cloud links to work.

    #   Create a Custom Field named `Tags'. The recommended type is "Enter
        one value," with "applies to Tickets." The recommended Description
        is "Freeform annotation for ready searching,"

    #   Apply the Custom Field to the desired queue.

BUGS
    *   Due to limitations in the available callbacks, the CF search blurb
        and tags cloud are output before the core search mechanism blurbs.

    *   Due to limitations in the available callbacks, every page loads the
        cloud css, which has also been hard-coded to 26 levels.
