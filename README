NAME
    Tag Cloud support for RT with simple-searchable custom fields.

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses portions of HTML::TagCloud to provide a tag cloud on
    Search/Simple.html The cloud consists of the values (split on commas,
    semi-colons and whitespace) for all objects with the `Tags' custom
    field.

    In addition to the cloud, documentation for using the Simple Searchable
    Custom Fields patch is included on the page, since the patch is required
    in order for the cloud anchors to work.

INSTALL
    #   Install HTML::TagCloud

    #   Install this module i.e; extract to local/plugins/RTx-Tags & ammend
        SiteConfig

        These first steps may be accomplished via CPAN(PLUS) with
        auto-dependencies.

    #   No patching necessary! If you've previously applied the
        SearchCustomField, or installed version 0.021 of this module, it is
        recomended that you revert the patch. No harm will come from not
        doing so, but better to keep RT core files vanilla where possible.

    #   Create a Custom Field named `Tags'. The recommended type is "Enter
        one value," with "Applies to Tickets." The recommended Description
        is "Freeform annotation for ready searching."

    #   Apply the Custom Field to the desired queue(s).

CAVEATS
    *   Due to limitations in the available callbacks, the CF search blurb
        and tags cloud are output before the core search mechanism blurbs;
        postform is ugly.

    *   Due to limitations in the available callbacks, every page links to
        cloud.css, which has also been hard-coded to 26 levels.

    *   Due to the mechanism used to implement the CF search, the presence
        of another Search/Googleish_Local.pm will likely not result in
        behavior you desire. Should you wish to make further local
        customizations, either modify this module's code, or use
        Googleish_Vendor.pm
